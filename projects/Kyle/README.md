# Kyle in Minions
Kyle is a pet dog belonging to Gru, and then given to Agnes. He was originally a vicious, aggressive, ferocious, and monstrous blue creature that even Gru had trouble controlling. Despite he ran away from Agnes, unused to the fact that she thought he is cute instead of trying to avoid him. However, he later became attached to her.

# Later plans:
I plan to make two steering modules for Kyle:
- Agnes - a module with joystick
- Gru - a mobile app
